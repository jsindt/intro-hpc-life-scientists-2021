<h2>Description</h2>

  High-performance computing (HPC) is a fundamental technology used to solve 
  a wide range of scientific research problems. Many important challenges in 
  science such as protein folding, the search for the Higgs boson, drug 
  discovery, and the development of nuclear fusion all depend on simulations, 
  models and analyses run on HPC facilities to make progress.

  This course introduces HPC to life science researchers, focusing on the 
  aspects that are most important for those new to this technology to 
  understand. It will help you judge how HPC can best benefit your research, 
  and equip you to go on to successfully and efficiently make use of HPC 
  facilities in future. The course will cover basic concepts in HPC hardware, 
  software, user environments, filesystems, and programming models. It also 
  provides an opportunity to gain hands-on practical experience and assistance 
  using an HPC system (ARCHER2, the UK national supercomputing service) 
  through examples drawn from the life sciences, such as biomolecular 
  simulation.

  <strong>Accessibility:</strong> We are committed to making this workshop
  accessible to everybody.
  The workshop organizers have checked that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.</li>
  <li>Accessible restrooms are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Materials will be provided in advance of the lesson and
  large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the
  organizers in advance.  If we can help making learning easier for
  you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please
  get in touch (using contact details below) and we will
  attempt to provide them.

> ## Prerequisites
> You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
> using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
> You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
> on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`). Finally, you should be 
> comfortable with compiling parallel HPC source code that uses MPI and OpenMP.
